# About Me

I am a second-year graduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Mechanical Engineering, specializing in 3D reconstruction and image generation models. Currently, I am working as an Image Generation Algorithm Intern at Zulution AI, where I focus on developing cutting-edge solutions for story-based image generation.
